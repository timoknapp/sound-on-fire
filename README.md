## Remote Control via Smartphone

The main idea with this is to simply use your smartphone as a remote control for using SoundOnFire. The first draft of the this will focus on using it as a keyboard such that you could search for tracks using your smartphone keyboard.

In case you are more interested in this feature you can go [here](REMOTE_CONTROL.md) and have a look the diagrams.

## Known Issues

- **BUG**: âœ… [#27](https://github.com/timoknapp/sound-on-fire/issues/27) Tracks longer than ~ 40 minutes will stop unexpectedly and next track continues. Its a known issue and it seems to relate to an unexpected connection loss of the stream. The logs show the following error:
    - `W/MediaHTTPConnection( 3979): readAt 36823797 / 7435 => java.net.ProtocolException: unexpected end of stream`

## Contribution

PRs Welcome!

## Setting up dev

Easiest way to setup your development environment is simply opening the project in VScode (Dart and Flutter extensions too). You will also need to download Flutter's SDK and add it to your PATH, you can do so in the following [link](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
.

 After the installation process, you will need to set up a device or emulator; Follow the instructions in the following links depending on your choose.

- [iOS](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [android](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#android-setup)

If you already have an emulator or device recogniced by VSCode, then you just need to launch the app by going to `main.dart` and pressing `F5`.

### Troubleshouting 

- Running `flutter doctor` might hint you some issues with missing dependencies. Such as:

```
[âœ—] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices
    âœ— Unable to locate Android SDK.
      Install Android Studio from: https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
      On first launch it will assist you in installing the Android SDK components.
      (or visit https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#android-setup for detailed instructions).
      If the Android SDK has been installed to a custom location, please use
      `flutter config --android-sdk` to update to that location.
```

- If running `flutter create .` fails; check the folder project name and make it compliant with Dart [rules](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec#name) .
