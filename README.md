## Remote Control via Smartphone

The main idea with this is to simply use your smartphone as a remote control for using SoundOnFire. The first draft of the this will focus on using it as a keyboard such that you could search for tracks using your smartphone keyboard.

In case you are more interested in this feature you can go [here](REMOTE_CONTROL.md) and have a look the diagrams.

## Known Issues

- **BUG**: âœ… [#27](https://github.com/timoknapp/sound-on-fire/issues/27) Tracks longer than ~ 40 minutes will stop unexpectedly and next track continues. Its a known issue and it seems to relate to an unexpected connection loss of the stream. The logs show the following error:
    - `W/MediaHTTPConnection( 3979): readAt 36823797 / 7435 => java.net.ProtocolException: unexpected end of stream`
